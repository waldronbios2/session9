# Intro: hierarchical and longitudinal data

## What are hierarchical and longitudinal data?

* Knee radiographs are taken yearly in order to understand the onset of osteoarthritis
* An indicator of heart damage is measured at 1, 3, and 6 days following a brain hemorrhage.
* Groups of patients in a urinary incontinence trial are assembled from different treatment centers
* Susceptibility to tuberculosis is measured in family members
* A study of the choice of type of surgery to treat a brain aneurysm either by clipping the base of the aneurysm or implanting a small coil. The study is conducted by measuring the type of surgery a patient receives from a number of surgeons at a number of different institutions.

## What is the distinction between hierarchical and longitudinal data?

* Longitudinal data are repeated measures over time
* Longitudinal data are a type of hierarchical data
    - repeated measures are correlated, and nested within the observational unit (individual)
* Other non-longitudinal data can also be hierarchical

_Definition_: Hierarchical data are data (responses or predictors) collected from or specific to different levels within a study.

## Important features of this type of data

1. The outcomes are correlated across observations
2. The predictor variables can be associated with different levels of a hierarchy.  _e.g._ we might be interested in:
     - the volume of operations at the hospital, 
     - whether it is a for-profit or not-for-profit hospital,
     - years of experience of the surgeon or where surgeons were trained, 
     - how the choice of surgery type depends on the age and gender of the patient.

# Fecal Fat example

## A Repeated Measures Example

* Lack of digestive enzymes in the intestine can cause bowel absorption problems.
     - This will be indicated by excess fat in the feces. 
     - Pancreatic enzyme supplements can alleviate the problem.
     - fecfat.csv: a study of fecal fat quantity (g/day) for individuals given each of a placebo and 3 types of pills

## Option 1: non-hierarchical analysis (wrong)
```{r readdata, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(gridExtra)
})
dat <- read.csv("fecfat.csv") %>%
  mutate(pilltype = factor(pilltype, levels = c("none", "tablet", "capsule", "coated"))) %>%
  mutate(subject = factor(subject))
```

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dat, aes(pilltype, fecfat)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, aes(size=1.5), alpha=0.9) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Option 1: non-hierarchical analysis (wrong)

\footnotesize
```{r dofit1way}
fit1way <- lm(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=dat)
```

```{r showfit1way, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xtable)
otype <- ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), "html", "latex")
xt <-
  xtable(anova(fit1way), caption = "One-way analysis of variance table for fecal fat dataset")
print(xt, comment=FALSE, type = otype)
```


* Does not account for similarity of measurements within individual
* Would be correct if each treatment were given to a different individual

```{r minusmean, echo=FALSE}
dat <- mutate(dat, fecfatminusmean = residuals(lm(fecfat ~ subject, data = dat)))
```

## Option 2: 2-way AOV

* Accounts for individual differences in mean fecal fat
* Fits a coefficient for mean fecal fat per individual
* Getting closer

```{r ggspaghetti, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = pilltype, y = fecfat, group = subject, lty = subject)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(subtitle = "Raw data") +
  xlab("Treatment") + ylab("Fecal Fat (mg/day)")
p2 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = pilltype, y = fecfatminusmean, group = subject, lty = subject)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(subtitle = "Subject means subtracted") +
  xlab("Treatment") + ylab("Fecal Fat (mg/day)")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2, respect = TRUE)
```

## Option 2: 2-way AOV

\footnotesize

```{r fit1wayagain}
fit1way <- lm(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=dat)
```
```{r xtable2, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(
  xtable::xtable(anova(fit1way), caption = "One-way analysis of variance table for fecal fat dataset"),
  comment = FALSE,
  type = otype
)
```

```{r fit2way}
fit2way <- lm(fecfat ~ subject + pilltype, data=dat)
```
```{r xtablefit2way, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(
  xtable(anova(fit2way), label = "2", caption = "Two-way analysis of variance table. Note the similarity of the pilltype row."),
  comment = FALSE,
  type = otype
)
```

## What happened??

* 1-way ANOVA correctly estimates the effect of pill type
* However, 1-way ANOVA fails to accommodate the correlation within subjects
* 1-way ANOVA over-estimates the residual variance
     - under-estimates the significance of pill type

## Regression models for 1 and 2-way ANOVA

* Recall for ordinary multiple linear regression:
\begin{equation*}
E[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p
\end{equation*}
     - $x_p$ are the predictors or independent variables
     - $y$ is the outcome, response, or dependent variable
     - $E[y|x]$ is the expected value of $y$ given $x$
     - $\beta_p$ are the regression coefficients

## Regression models for 1 and 2-way ANOVA

* One-way ANOVA (person $i$ with pill type $j$):
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
FECFAT_{ij} &= \textrm{fecal fat measurement for person i with pill type j} \\
            &= \mu + PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

* Two-way ANOVA:
\begin{equation*}
FECFAT_{ij} = \mu + SUBJECT_i + PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
\phantom{\hspace{3cm}}
\end{equation*}

Assumption: $\epsilon_{ij} \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

# Correlations within subjects (ICC)

## Correlations within subjects

* One-way ANOVA fails because it does not account for the correlation of measurements within-person
* How highly correlated are measurements on the same person? Consider subject $i$, pill types $j$ and $k$:

\begin{equation*}
corr(FECFAT_{ij}, FECFAT_{ik}) = 
          \frac{cov(FECFAT_{ij}, FECFAT_{ik})}
               {sd(FECFAT_{ij}) sd(FECFAT_{ik})}
\end{equation*}
* This is a measure of how large the subject effect is, in relation to the error term

## Correlation within subjects

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
cov(FECFAT_{ij}, FECFAT_{ik}) &= cov(SUBJECT_i, SUBJECT_i) \\
                              &= var(SUBJECT_i) \\
                              &= \sigma_{subject}^2. \textrm{(definition)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

* Equality 1:
    + $\mu$ and $pilltype$ terms are assumed to be constant, so do not enter into covariance calculation
    + residuals $\epsilon$ are assumed to be independent
* Equality 2: 
    + covariance with self is variance

Recall $SUBJECT_i$ is the term for individual in 2-way AOV. Now $\beta_i * subjectID$, will later be treated as a **random variable**

## Correlation within subjects

Previous slide calculated *covariance* for numerator of correlation. Now calculate *variance* for the denominator (${sd(FECFAT_{ij}) * sd(FECFAT_{ik})} = var(FECFAT_{ij})$)

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
var(FECFAT_{ij}) &= var(SUBJECT_i, SUBJECT_i) + var(\epsilon_{ij}) \\
                              &= \sigma_{subject}^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2. \textrm{(definition)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

* Difference is that the independent residuals do contribute to $var(FECFAT_{ij})$
* Variance is broken into componenets due to *subject* and *residual* variance

## Intraclass Correlation

The correlation between two treatments $j$ and $k$ across subjects $i$ is:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
corr(FECFAT_{ij}, FECFAT_{ik}) & = 
          \frac{cov(FECFAT_{ij}, FECFAT_{ik})}
               {sd(FECFAT_{ij}) sd(FECFAT_{ik})} \\
      & = \frac{\sigma_{subj}^2}{\sigma_{subj}^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2} \\
ICC & = \frac{\tau_{00}^2}{\tau_{00}^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

## Intuition behind correlations within subjects

![Fecal Fat dataset](VittinghoffTable71.png)

\footnotesize
```{r makewide, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyr)
dat.wide <- dat %>% 
  select(-fecfatminusmean) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = pilltype, values_from = fecfat) %>%
  mutate(MEAN = (none+tablet+capsule+coated)/4)
```

Variance of the subject averages (`r round(var(dat.wide$MEAN), 1)`) is increased by correlation of measurements within individual.

## Calculation of correlations within subjects (ICC)

What is your estimate of the variability due to subjects, from the 2-way ANOVA?
\footnotesize
```{r sumresid}
sum(residuals(fit2way)^2) / 15 / 4 #df=15, divided by 4 pilltypes
279.419 - 26.75 #var(SUBJECT_i)
```
Residual variance is:
```{r sumresid2}
sum(residuals(fit2way)^2) / 15 #df=15
```

## Calculation of correlations within subjects (ICC)

Finally calculate ICC:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
ICC &= \frac{\sigma_{subj}^2}{\sigma_{subj}^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2} \\
    &= \frac{253}{253 + 107}
    &= 0.70
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

This calculation will become easier when we learn to estimate *random coefficients* in directly in the regression model.

# Random and fixed effects

## The next step: a mixed effects model

* Two-way ANOVA is a fixed effects model:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{subject i} SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
     - Assumption: $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

* Instead of fitting a $\beta_{subject i}$ to each individual, assume that subject effects are selected from a distribution of possible subject effects:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \mu + SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
where $SUBJECT_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_{subj}^2)$

* Here subject is a _random_ effect, and pill type is a _fixed_ effect.
* This is also a random intercept model

## Random and fixed effects

![Random and Fixed Effects](VittinghoffTable714.png)

## Summary: correlations within subjects

* Subject-to-subject variability simultaneously raises or lowers all the observations on a subject
     - induces correlation of within-subject measurements
* Variability of individual measurements can be separated into that due to subjects and that left to residual variance.
     - $var(FECFAT_{ij}) = \sigma_{subj}^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2$
* 2-way ANOVA does not directly estimate variability due to subjects
     - variance of coefficients for individual is not too far off

## Summary: hierarchical data

* Estimates of coefficients (or "effect sizes") are unchanged by hierarchical modeling
* Ignoring within-subject correlations results in incorrect estimates of variance, F statistics, p-values
     - not always "conservative"
* Intraclass Correlation (ICC) provides a measure of correlation induced by grouping
* Should be able to recognize fixed and random effects
